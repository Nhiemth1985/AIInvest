# What is it?
Live trading bot using Binance API stock exchange. The primary goal of the bot is to create environment that will be able to monitor, calculate technical indicators and use that information to trade in Binance Stock Exchange live. In back of my head I am keeping in mind idea of a bot that would be able to trade among many stock exchange for example Nasdaq, BitMex etc.
